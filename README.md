# Neural Style Transfer: Create AI-Generated Art 🎨🖌️

Transform your photos into stunning digital art using the power of Neural Style Transfer!

## 🌟 Overview

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an innovative AI technique that combines the content of one image with the artistic style of another. This project implements a state-of-the-art NST model using TensorFlow and Keras, allowing you to create unique artworks from your photos.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore and implement Neural Style Transfer techniques
- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy art creation
- Provide a platform for creating potential NFT artworks

## 🧠 How It Works

NST leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to separate and recombine the content and style of different images. The process involves:

1. Using a pre-trained feature extractor (typically a VGG network)
2. Implementing a transfer network with an encoder-decoder architecture
3. Optimizing the output image to minimize both content and style losses

Our implementation uses a pre-trained "Arbitrary Neural Artistic Stylization Network," capable of applying various artistic styles to any input image in a single, efficient pass.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-style-transfer.git
   cd neural-style-transfer
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the pre-trained model from [this link](https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2) and place it in the `model` directory.

### Usage

You can use the Neural Style Transfer model in two ways:

1. Through the Python API:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from API import transfer_style

model_path = "path/to/model/directory"
content_image_path = "path/to/your/content/image.jpg"
style_image_path = "path/to/your/style/image.jpg"

stylized_image = transfer_style(content_image_path, style_image_path, model_path)
plt.imsave('stylized_image.jpg', stylized_image)
plt.imshow(stylized_image)
plt.show()
```

2. Through the provided application:

```
python app.py
```
